# -Heart-Transplant-Survival-Analysis
Heart-Transplant-Survival-Analysis is a statistical modeling project focused on understanding long-term outcomes of patients who underwent heart transplants. Using both R (survival package) and Python (lifelines), the study applied Kaplan–Meier estimators to estimate survival probabilities over time and compared groups across different clinical covariates. To evaluate the influence of patient characteristics and medical factors, the analysis fitted Cox Proportional Hazards models, producing interpretable hazard ratios that quantify relative risk. The results were visualized through survival curves, log–log plots, and diagnostic checks, providing clear insights into survival differences and proportional hazards assumptions. This project highlights how survival analysis techniques can be applied to clinical data to identify key risk factors that influence transplant success, offering valuable evidence for both research and medical decision-making.
