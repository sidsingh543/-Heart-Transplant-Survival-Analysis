# -Heart-Transplant-Survival-Analysis
Conducted survival analysis on patient heart transplant data using R (survival package) and Python (lifelines) to study long-term outcomes. Applied Kaplanâ€“Meier estimators to estimate survival probabilities and fitted Cox Proportional Hazards models to evaluate covariate effects. Produced interpretable hazard ratios and survival plots, identifying key risk factors influencing transplant success.
